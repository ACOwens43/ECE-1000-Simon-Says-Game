# ECE-1000-Simon-Says-Game
This is a project for ECE 1000 class. Making a Simon Says Game using a Raspberry Pi Pico, Cathode LEDS, and LCD screen.

# Executive Summary
Simon Says is a classic memory game that challenges players to recall and repeat sequences of colors and sounds. This ECE-1000 project focuses on the design and assembly of an interactive Simon Says game prototype powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. The final product will be a functional and engaging device that allows players to test their memory skills through increasingly complex patterns of lights and sounds.
